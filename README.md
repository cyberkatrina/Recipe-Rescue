# Recipe-Rescue

Data I will need:

Table1: User

-user ID

-email

-password

-ingredients in fridge and pantry

-dietary restrictions

Table2: Recipes
-user ID
-meal name
-ingredient list
-cooking instructions

Relationship: the user ID is the primary key and foreign key for both tables. The User table has a one-to-many relationship with the Recipes table.
